virtual environment -- 
we create virtual environment to handle all the deoendencies
of our app.
libraries 
whatever we download 


every step or every new library/framework
goes through these steps 
1.installing
2.importing
3.configuration if needed
4.initialization
5.integration

Flask-Migrate
When in between of development database has some important data stored
we try to add a column in the database it doesnt add because db.create_all() is for just 
creating the tablesss that are not there (if not there)
To modify table properties in between u need to use Flask-Migrate
Flask-Migrate will help you track your migrations in database as well as quickly modify them


After integration
Whenever you are running the migration for the first time 
you need to initialize migrationss folder

initialize migration folder
flask db init

everytime u make changes to the database 
flask db migrate -m "Changes that u did to communicate as a message"
flask db upgrade


2 things 
1. Adding origin -- in which repo should i send

2. Authrntication




Github
Make git init to initialize repo in local 
then create repository in github 
add origin for the path in which u want to send the code

create an ssh key in terminal----> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your-email>"
activate agent and save the key
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
copy key and add it to github same profile --> # print the public key to terminal
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

(If a collaborator they will clone)

git add .
git commit -m "message of commit"
git push 
git status to see the commit changes
